### Authentication Bypass

Learn how to defeat logins and other authentication mechanisms to allow you access to unpermitted areas.

1) Username Enumeration: Trying to find valid existing usernames in a site using ‚Äúffuf‚Äù

> ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames/Names/names.txt -X POST -d "username=FUZZ&email=x&password=x&cpassword=x" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded‚Äù -u HTTP:/ip/customers/signup -mr ‚Äúusername already exists‚Äù
> 

In the above example, the `-w` argument selects the file's location on the computer that contains the list of usernames that we're going to check exists. The `-X` argument specifies the request method, this will be a GET request by default, but it is a POST request in our example. The `-d`
 the argument specifies the data that we are going to send. In our example, we have username, email, password and cpassword. We've set the value of the username to **FUZZ**
. In the ffuf tool, the FUZZ keyword signifies where the contents from our wordlist will be inserted in the request. The `-H` argument is used for adding additional headers to the request. In this instance, we're setting the `Content-Type` to the webserver knows we are sending form data. The `-u`
 argument specifies the URL we are making the request to, and finally, the `-mr` argument is the text on the page we are looking for to validate we've found a valid username.

- What is the username starting with si*** ? simon
- What is the username starting with st*** ? steve
- What is the username starting with ro**** ? robert

2) Brute force the login using the usernames that were discovered 

Create a txt file using the usernames that were discovered in step 1 and pass it as Wordlist1 and picks  password list from the lists available .

3) Logic Flaws :

Sometimes authentication processes contain logic flaws. A logic flaw is when the typical logical path of an application is either bypassed, circumvented or manipulated by a hacker. Logic flaws can exist in any area of a website, but we're going to concentrate on examples relating to authentication in this instance.
Exploiting the POST and GET queries  

We use the -H flag to add an additional header to the request. In this instance, we are setting the Content-Type to application/x-www-form-urlencoded , which lets the web server know we are sending form data so it properly understands our request. In the application, the user account is retrieved using the query string, but later on, in the application logic, the password reset email is sent using the data found in the PHP variable `$_REQUEST`.

The PHP `$_REQUEST`  variable is an array that contains data received from the query string 
and POST data. If the same key name is used for both the query string and POST data, the application logic for this variable favors POST data  fields rather than the query string, so if we add another parameter to the POST form, we can control where the password reset email gets 
delivered.

- What is the flag from Robert‚Äôs support ticket? THM{AUTH_BYPASSS_COMPLETE}

4) Cookie Tampering :

****Set-Cookie: logged_in=true; Max-Age=3600; Path=/
Set-Cookie: admin=false; Max-Age=3600; Path=/**

using curl and -H tag manipulate the cookies and get the flag. 

- What is the flag from changing the plain text cookie values? THM{COOKIE_TAMPERING}
- What is the value of the md5 hash 3b2a1053e3270077456a79192070aa78 ? 463729
- What is the base64 decoded value of VEhNe0JBU0U2NF9FTkNPRElOR30= ? thm{base64_encoding}
- Encode the following value using base64 {"id":1,"admin":true} : eyJpZCI6MSwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWV9

## IDOR

IDOR stands for: Insecure Direct Object Reference

This type of vulnerability can occur when a web server receives user-supplied input to retrieve objects (files, data, documents), too much trust has been placed on the input data, and it is not validated on the server side to confirm the requested object belongs to the user requesting it.

What is the Flag from the IDOR example website? **THM{IDOR-VULN-FOUND}**

What is the common algorithm used for hashing IDs?  md5

What is the minimum number of accounts you need to create to check for IDORs between accounts? 2
